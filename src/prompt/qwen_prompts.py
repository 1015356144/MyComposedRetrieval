You are given two images (left: reference, right: target).
Original modification description: "{original_text}"

Perform the following tasks step by step:

1. **Generate Captions**: Write clear captions for both images.
2. **Compare Captions**: Highlight visual differences.
3. **Generate Polar Questions**: Ask yes/no style comparison questions.
4. **Answer Questions via Image Comparison**: Answer them based on the two images.
5. **Local Edits**: Describe fine-grained changes from reference to target.
6. **Decompose Intents**: Summarize the main modification intents.
7. **Generate Text_new**: Finally, write a single natural sentence ("text_new") that can be used as a modification query for retrieval.

Output must be valid JSON with a field "text_new".
